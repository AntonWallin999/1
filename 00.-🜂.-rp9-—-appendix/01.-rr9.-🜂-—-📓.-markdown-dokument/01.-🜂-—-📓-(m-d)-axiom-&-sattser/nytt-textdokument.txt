# Formal Consequence D2 (Approximation–Cause Incompatibility)

Given Axiom R0, Theorem T0, and Corollary C0, it follows necessarily that:

1. Any formal verification framework that relies on axioms accepted by convention,
   belief, or representational adequacy operates by approximation rather than cause.

2. All such approximation-based frameworks are secondary informational structures
   and cannot establish absolute truth status for problems whose resolution
   requires absolute informational grounding.

3. R0 (Vesica Piscis) constitutes an absolute geometric relation and primary cause,
   requiring neither approximation nor belief, but only relational invariance.

4. Therefore, any framework that excludes R0 as absolute cause cannot, by construction,
   resolve problems that demand absolute verification.

This yields an unavoidable institutional question:

Has the prevailing formal framework failed to recognize the existence of an absolute
geometric informational cause, or does it elect to proceed without one?

Continued operation without addressing this incompatibility implies acceptance of
non-absolute informational status and forfeiture of absolute relevance.

No assertion of intent is made.
The consequence follows solely from structural incompatibility.
